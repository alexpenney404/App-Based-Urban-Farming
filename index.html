  <h1>App-based Urban Farming Concepts</h1>
  <h2>A transformative approach to community nutrition</h2>
  <em>
    <p>
      Before heading home from work, you pull up an app on your phone and see that your favorite local garden has the first tomatoes of the season available. At last! You park on the street in a quiet little neighborhood and make your way to a house
      whose front yard has been converted into a garden. There's a sign on the little gate: "Public Garden: See App For Prices and other info." with app QR codes displayed underneath. You go in and fill up your little shopping bag with a few things
      you'll need for tonight's dinner: tomatoes, onions, peppers, ooh! They even have some cilantro. You go home and prepare a delicious meal, and before heading to bed you send them a little money via the same app. As you drift off to sleep you
      wonder when the bok choy in that new garden down the street is going to be ready...
    </p>
  </em>
  <p>
    Gardening is a rewarding hobby, not least because it is challenging for most of us. The prospect of earning a little money from small-scale gardening at home, or at least breaking even, adds to the reward and feeling of accomplishment on the part
    of the gardener. Growing our own food is also a golden opportunity to maximize its quality: it allows us to get away from the highly processed, artificially fertilized, pesticide and herbicide-ridden foods we find at the grocery store, and enjoy
    the better taste and nutritional quality of fresh, organic produce. It's also better for the environment; consider all of the fossil fuels that are burned in the process of growing, processing, and shipping produce and the effects of artifical
    fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides on watersheds and other habitats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting people involved in growing food for their friends and neighbors also brings them together and creates opportunities for the kinds of wholesome real-world interactions that enrich our lives and make our communities stronger and more
    inclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to share some concepts for facilitating small-scale urban farming, all leveraging the connective power of the internet and mobile devices. I'll be presenting them at three levels of complexity, with each level including all previous
    ones.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Level 1: The Roadside Self-Serve Garden</h3>
  <h4>A simple system for simple salad sellers</h4>
  <p>
    At this level, there are only two kinds of participants, or actors, involved: owner/gardeners and buyers. As such, there would only need to be two kinds of accounts in the app. Here's how it works:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>A homeowner marks off a portion of their outdoor space and designates it as open to the public, with restrictions.</li>
    <li>They plant a garden and set up signs and/or fences to direct visitors to public areas.</li>
    <li>They create an account on an app that displays their garden's location, instructions to visitors,
      and updates on which fruits and vegetables are ready to be harvested.</li>
    <li>Customers show up and harvest the produce that they want, and pay through the same app.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Potential App functions at this level:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Guiding owner/gardeners through any licensure, permits, or certification that may be required in their area.</li>
    <li>Suggesting what produce to grow to owner/gardeners based on buyer polls, what other gardeners are growing or have grown in their area, and local sales data. </li>
    <li>Incentivizing good behavior through buyer and owner/gardener ratings and rewards on both sides for getting good ratings.</li>
    <li>Tools for helping owner/gardeners to plan when and how much of different produce to plant. This would also allow buyers to see what produce is being grown or will be grown in the future.</li>
    <li>Live stream connectivity for owner/gardeners to help showcase their garden to customers, give them an idea of what to expect, and deter criminal or untoward behavior.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Positive Outcomes</h4>
  <p>
    This model makes it easy for owner/gardeners to connect with buyers, without having to spend time and money getting their produce to a wholesaler or selling it in person at a farmer's market or farm stand.
  </p>
  <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
  <p>
    Homeowners in many areas may be understandably reluctant to let strangers onto their property unsupervised, even when fences, signage, and barriers are used to keep private spaces private. Buyers, meanwhile, may be deterred by having to harvest
    and wash produce themselves, and it will be relatively inconvenient to have to drive to a location to obtain only a few items, compared to simply going to a store.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Level 2: The Urban Farming Micro-Economy</h3>
  <h4>Bringing Together Land, Labor, Capital, and Entrepreneurship</h4>
  <p>This level is where things start to get a bit more involved. To begin with, a few more kinds of participants are introduced:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Owners:</strong> own property that they make available to use as garden space or as market space, but who don't necessarily work on it themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Garden Operators:</strong> plan and execute garden operations on their own property or on Owners' property.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Operators:</strong> plan, promote, and prepare swap meet-style gatherings for Market Vendors to sell produce at.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Vendors:</strong> buy produce in bulk from garden operators and sell them at a market.</li>
    <li><strong>Helpers:</strong> assist garden operators, market operators, and vendors, who pay them to plant, harvest, maintain, and clean up garden spaces, or to transport and sell produce at market.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    In a nutshell, this level facilitates grassroots farmers' markets as well as a more sophisticated system for specialization within the urban farming micro-economy. At this level, someone who owns a little piece of property but is too busy or
    lacks the expertise to plant a garden on it themselves can find a gardening expert to lease or rent out the use of their land. People wanting to work a garden but who don't have the space or expertise for planning one can find work as helpers to
    garden operators, potentially in a gig work format similar to rideshare companies.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's worth noting here that one person can fill multiple roles in this system. For example, a homeowner can be their own garden operator, act as a market operator by making all the arrangements for a weekly farmers' market on their property, and
    act as a market vendor by having their own booth at the market. For this reason an app implementation at this level would use an omnibus login system, where one user account offers multiple modalities.
  </p>
  <h4>Potential App functions at this level:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All level 1 App functions</li>
    <li>Automated advertising of farmers' markets and self-serve gardens on social media platforms</li>
    <li>Helping users through the process of getting necessary permits for farmers' markets</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>Level 3: Going Big and Getting Smart</h3>
  <h4>Incorporating innovative marketing and supply chain models to make urban farming competetive in the produce market.</h4>

  <p>
    So far we've built up a fairly sophisticated app-based micro-economy, but an honest assessment of its potential for getting produce from urban farmer to consumer still places it in the shadow of mainstream produce supply chains. What is still
    missing is a way for local produce to find its way to consumers in a way that is more convenient for the consumer than going to a grocery store.
  </p>
  <p>Two new kinds of participants are introduced to tackle this challenge:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aggregators:</strong> Purchase produce from garden operators or vendors, and put together customer-specified or curated produce boxes for delivery to customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Route Drivers:</strong>Pick up produce from garden operators, deliver bulk produce to market vendors and aggregators, and deliver produce boxes directly to customers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Potential App functions at this level:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All level 1 and 2 App functions</li>
    <li>Customer interface that allows them to browse available produce boxes or order a custom box.</li>
    <li>Route Optimization for route drivers.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
  <h4>Guiding principles for implementation</h4>
  <p>
    In this model, the organization behind the app plays the role of a facilitator and promoter, rather than a direct participant in the local urban farming economies it helps to create. It would leave growing, shipping, aggregating, processing, and
    selling produce products to its users, and instead focus on advertising, branding, and promoting urban farming as a movement.
